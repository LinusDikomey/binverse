# BinVerSe (**Bin**ary **Ver**sioned **Se**rializer)

Provides fast binary serialization with versioning to store data in a backwards-compatible, compact way.

Right now, the crate is still work in progress and I wouldn't recommend using it for larger projects as breaking changes and problems might occur.

## Features
- [x] Simple, fast binary serialization
- [x] Versioning using revision numbers
- [x] Error handling
- [ ] Procedural macros to avoid boilerplate code (coming soon)
